	* Begining of changelog
	* Added a new utility called denoise that tries to remove some poisson
	noise from a picture. Please check utils/denois.c for details.
	* Added background_subtract which tries to subtract the background of a
	series of similar pictures. It's too specific for general usage though.
	* Started to build static binaries for easier installation.
