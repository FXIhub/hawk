2008-08-16	Filipe Maia	<filipe@xray.bmc.uu.se>
	* Added the capability to work with 3D images.
	* Added many new options to control the support update mechanism.
	* Added a metadata options file which includes some options documentation
	* Added more examples and a few preliminary benchmarks
	* Added the option of comparing the current solution with an expected solution using
	the solution_file option.
	* Added the possibility to filter the intensities at runtime according to the support
	using the filter_intensities option.
	* Changed the way images are rescaled so that now the image guess is scaled to the
	experimental intensities so that they both have the same power (sum of squares)
	* Added the option to specify a file with the standard deviations of each pixel
	for the intensity file, using the intensities_std_dev_file option.
	* Added the option to specify the support of the autocorrelation for denoising
	purposes using the autocorrelation_support_file option.
	* Added a two graphical programs to look at images. Look and Preview. They can
	also be used for some basic manipulation.
	* Added a program to convert images to reflection lists.
	* Many other small improvements and code cleaning.

	* Added the image_blur_radius and image_blur_period options.
	When image_blur_period is different than 0, the real image
	image will be gaussian blurred using a standard deviation
	of image_blur_radius every image_blur_period iteration.

2007-04-19	Filipe Maia	<filipe@xray.bmc.uu.se>

	* Introduced the "object_area" option, which is a floating point
	number which quantifies what's the area of the object compared
	to the size of the image. It can take values between 0.0 and 1.0.
	* Added a new support update algorithm called "constant_area".
	It simply keeps the area of the support fixed. The support area
	is given by the new "object_area" option.

2007-04-18	Filipe Maia	<filipe@xray.bmc.uu.se>

	* Fixed the fourier space error calculation for the RAAR algorithm.

2007-04-13	Filipe Maia	<filipe@xray.bmc.uu.se>

	* Changed the boolean "blur_radius" option to a float "patterson_blur_radius"
	that allows the set also the amount of blurring.
	* Fixed a bug in the initial estimation of the support, caused by incorrect
	calculation of the autocorrelation.
	* Split the support functions and algorithm functions in 2 new files.

2007-04-12	Filipe Maia	<filipe@xray.bmc.uu.se>

	* Added a max_iterations option to uwrapc.conf that makes the program stop
	after that number of iterations has been reached.
	* Changed the -C option in process_image. Now it average the entire image
	assuming centrosymmetry.

2007-03-28	Filipe Maia	<filipe@xray.bmc.uu.se>

	* Public svn repository at svn://130.238.41.203/hawk

2007-03-27	Filipe Maia	<filipe@xray.bmc.uu.se>

	* Fixed a critical bug in tiff2h5. The width and height were
	not being set before the autocorrelation was calculated.

2007-03-21	Filipe Maia	<filipe@xray.bmc.uu.se>

	* Begining of changelog
	* Added a new utility called denoise that tries to remove some poisson
	noise from a picture. Please check utils/denois.c for details.
	* Added background_subtract which tries to subtract the background of a
	series of similar pictures. It's too specific for general usage though.
	* Started to build static binaries for easier installation.
