This is an example of a 3D reconstruction.

The sample is made up of four spheres, their centers radii and
density is given in the following table. The units are pixels
and the whole image has the dimensions of 100x100x100 pixels.

Center     | Radius^2 | Density
--------------------------------
(45,47,50) | 7        | 5
(55,47,49) | 9        | 4
(50,57,52) | 12       | 7
(50,50,58) | 8        | 3

To do a reconstruction simply run uwrapc in the directory, the
uwrapc.conf file uses an algorithm that works and is set to work
on the right file, spheres.h5.

The image can be generated by running the program spheres.c
