NAME
----
hawk - the image reconstruction package


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'hawk' [--version] [--help] <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Hawk is a image reconstruction package that contains the tools necessary
to process and phase a continuous diffraction pattern. It is typically
used with diffraction patterns obtained from X-ray single particle 
diffraction experiments, such as those performed at X-ray free-electron
lasers and table-top X-ray lasers, but the algorithms should 
work for other diffraction experiments such as electron or optical
diffraction.

OPTIONS
-------
*--version*::
	Prints the Hawk package version.

*--help*::
	Prints the synopsis along with a list and short explanation
  of the possible commands. When given a <command> it will show
  the man page of that <command>, for example *hawk --help convert*
  will show the man page for hawk-convert.

COMMANDS
--------

*convert*::
  Converts files between different file formats.

*phase*::
  Phase a diffraction pattern.

*prepare*::
  Prepare an image for phasing.
