NAME
----
hawk-prepare - Prepare an image for phasing


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'hawk prepare' <-i infile> <-o outfile> [-s <saturation>] 
	[-g <background>] [-b <beamstop>] [-m <mask file>] [-p]
	[-r <crop radius>] [-C] [-c <center>] [-d <dark file>] [-S]
	[-n <noise file>] [-f <filter radius>] [-a <downsample>] 
	[-t=<smoothness>] [-e=<filler file>] [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Processes images so that they are in a suitable format for phasing. It is capable of
doing many different operations (too many?), which help turn a raw detector image
into a datafile which incorpates knowledge about, among others, beam position, 
dead pixels, detector background and detector saturation level. It also allows 
includes tools to speed up the reconstruction by padding the image such that the
dimensions are a power of 2, the possibly downsample the image and to crop the
center of the image when only a low resolution reconstruction is necessary.

OPTIONS
-------
*-i <infile>*::
The input filename. It should be in a format that *hawk-convert*(1) can understand.
The input file will not be altered.

*-o outfile>*::
The output filename, after all the operations have been performed.

*-s <saturation>*::
	Set values above the *<saturation>* to 0 and set the equivalent mask pixel
	to 0.

*-v*::
	Turn on verbose output.

*-h*::
	Print help text.

// We could use some


EXAMPLES
-------

*hawk prepare -i image.tiff -o image.h5 -s 64000 -g 200 -a 2*

Will read *image.tiff* and covert it into a CXI file named *image.cxi*.
